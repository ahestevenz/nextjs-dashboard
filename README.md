### Exploring the Project

Unlike tutorials that have you write code from scratch, much of the code for this course is already written for you. This better reflects real-world development, where you'll likely be working with existing codebases.

Our goal is to help you focus on learning the main features of Next.js, without having to write all the application code.

After installation, open the project in your code editor and navigate to `nextjs-dashboard`.

- **/app**: Contains all the routes, components, and logic for your application. This is where you'll be mostly working from.
- **/app/lib**: Contains functions used in your application, such as reusable utility functions and data fetching functions.
- **/app/ui**: Contains all the UI components for your application, such as cards, tables, and forms. To save time, we've pre-styled these components for you.
- **/public**: Contains all the static assets for your application, such as images.
- **Config Files**: You'll also notice config files such as `next.config.js` at the root of your application. Most of these files are created and pre-configured when you start a new project using `create-next-app`. You will not need to modify them in this course.
